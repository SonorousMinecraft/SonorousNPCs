# Human-like NPCs for SereneOasis
__This plugin makes it possible to spawn NPCs that behave almost indistinguishably from players__ 

The NPCs can have different classes and their own behaviour depending on those.

They can also have different chat dialogues with basic conversations (players can choose between options), and GUIs when right clicked on to offer trades and quests.

The NPCs persist without players on.

This is a type of weak AI (namely Reactive Machine AI) because it does not have a memory and can only perform behaviour that is pre-determined.
However the Minecraft world is technically not stochastic so this doesn't serve as that much of an issue.
