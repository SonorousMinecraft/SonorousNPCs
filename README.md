# Human-like NPCs for SereneOasis

__This plugin makes it possible to spawn NPCs that behave almost indistinguishably from players__

The NPCs can have different classes and their own behaviour depending on those.

They can also have different chat dialogues with basic conversations (players can choose between options), and GUIs when
right clicked on to offer trades and quests.

The NPCs persist without players on.

This is a type of weak AI (namely Reactive Machine AI) because it does not have a memory and can only perform behaviour
that is pre-determined.
However the Minecraft world is technically not stochastic so this doesn't serve as that much of an issue.
